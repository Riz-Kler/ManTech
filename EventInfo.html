        <p style="line-height=100%">Resuming on 130-3 and needing to survive the final day in Dubai to earn a draw, the tourists were bowled out for 312 with only 6.3 overs remaining.
Rashid was last out for 61, while Stuart Broad made 30 and Mark Wood 29 after Joe Root fell for 71.
Yasir Shah took 4-87 and fellow spinner Zulfiqar Babar 3-53 for Pakistan, who lead 1-0 in the three-match series.
The final Test in Sharjah starts on 1 November.
England can take great credit for the character demonstrated in posting their highest fourth-innings total in Asia on a wearing pitch.
But they will surely reflect on the first-innings collapse from 206-3 to 242 all out, which effectively cost them this match.</p>
